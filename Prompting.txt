This is an iOS-first donation app intended for production and eventual App Store release, designed both as a real product and as a way to practice writing high-quality code. The app supports phone-number authentication via SMS verification and Apple Sign-In (SSO). After authentication, users land on a Home screen featuring four themed donation cards, each representing a curated cluster of nonprofits. Users can explore the nonprofits within a theme, select one or multiple nonprofits across themes, and complete a single unified donation flow. The Donate screen allows users to enter payment information, choose between one-time or recurring donations, and confirm their contribution, while modal screens are used for viewing nonprofits within a theme and reviewing donation history. Architecturally, the app uses expo-router with clear (auth) and (app) route groups, implements modals as router-based routes, manages local/UI/client state (such as the auth session, selected nonprofits, and form state) with Zustand, and handles all server-driven data (nonprofit listings, donation history, and donation submissions) with React Query. The UI should be built first, with external integrations like Stripe, SMS, and Apple Sign-In initially stubbed and added later.
When responding, assume production-grade patterns appropriate for a real App Store app, explain architectural decisions when they impact structure or scalability, and prioritize guidance, reasoning, and detailed comments over writing large amounts of code, so the primary implementation work remains with the developer.

CRITICAL: DO NOT MAKE CODE CHANGES, just comment and advise
